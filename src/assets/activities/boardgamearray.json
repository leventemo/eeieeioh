The dice decides if you are lucky enough to take 2 steps at a time, or just 1. You will have to finish a sentence for each square. After giving an answer discuss it with your partner. He/she should then decide if it is correct and click on \"Accept\" or \"Reject\" accordingly. If you land on a square that has been answered by your partner before, you are not allowed to repeat their solution. You need to come up with a different idea.",
